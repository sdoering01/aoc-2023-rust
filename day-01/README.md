# Advent of Code 2023 in Rust

This repository contains my solutions for [Advent of Code 2023](https://adventofcode.com/2023) in Rust.

Each day has its own binary crate. Upon execution, these crates print the output to `stdout`.

Running the solution for day 1 would look like this:

```sh
cd day-01
cargo run --release
```

# Disclaimer

The solutions are not necessarily written in a way to solve the
problem in the best possible way, but try to explore Rust's features. Thus they
may seem a little too sophisticated at times.
