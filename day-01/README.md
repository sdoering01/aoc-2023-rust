# Advent of Code 2023 in Rust

This repository contains my solutions for [Advent of Code 2023](https://adventofcode.com/2023) in Rust.

Each day has its own binary crate. Upon execution, these crates print the solution to `stdout`.

Running the crate for day 1 could look like this:

```sh
cd day-01
cargo run --release
```

## Disclaimer

The implementations are not necessarily written in a way to solve the problem
in the best possible way, but try to explore Rust's features and crates. Thus
they may seem a little too sophisticated at times.
